          Hello everyone! My name is Faiza Imania Putri, my friends usually call me
          Faiza. I am from Indonesia specifically in Pontianak, West Kalimantan.         
          For 18 years I live, I have never moved to another place. That’s why          
          sometimes I feel  bored with the environment and the atmosphere here.        
          But in my 19 I be required to go out of my hometown to continue my education,         
          then I realize how meaningful this place was for me. It feels so hard to         
          leave my hometown, the memories,  the people, the place that I usually visited.         
          Too many memories that this place gives to me. So with this post. I want to          
          introduce several destinations in my hometown and a bit about myself.

            though it makes you feel tired

              it has not been used for a

                ethical decision did not consider the laws.
