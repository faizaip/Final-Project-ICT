          Hello everyone! My name is Faiza Imania Putri, my friends usually call me
          Faiza. I am from Indonesia specifically in Pontianak, West Kalimantan.         
          For 18 years I live, I have never moved to another place. Thatâ€™s why          
          sometimes I feel  bored with the environment and the atmosphere here.        
          But in my 19 I be required to go out of my hometown to continue my education,         
          then I realize how meaningful this place was for me. It feels so hard to         
          leave my hometown, the memories,  the people, the place that I usually visited.         
          Too many memories that this place gives to me. So with this post. I want to          
          introduce several destinations in my hometown and a bit about myself.

            I joined martial art
            <br>
            (Shorinji Kempo) since
            <br>
            I was 8 years old.
            <br>
            Shorinji Kempo is an
            <br>
            old martial art from

            I love to go traveling
            <br>
            with my friends and my
            <br>
            family. But recently it
            <br>
            is hard to find the right
            <br>
            time since we have our
            <br>
            own activities.

            I love to go hiking with
            <br>
            my friends. It helps me
            <br>
            relieve my stress. Even
            <br>
            though it makes you feel tired
            <br>
            because you have to climb
            <br>
            it, but it is worth it!

            <a>
              It's called Blue Lake because
              <br>
              the watercolor is blue. This
              <br>
              lake used to be a query. But
              <br>
              it has not been used for a
              <br>
              a long time. Then it changes
              <br>
              into this beautiful place.

          <br>
          <a>
            The name of this waterfall was
            <br>
            created based on the folklore in
            <br>
            Sekadau Province. The beauty is
            <br>
            so mesmerizing and natural.
            <br>
            There is much variety of flora
            <br>
            growing around the waterfall.

            <a>
              This place is often visited by
              <br>
              the tourists because it is
              <br>
              located near the roadway. There
              <br>
              is also a hill and many big
              <br>
              stones spread in the sand that
              <br>
              you can only see it at a low tide.
